											<h2 style="font-weight: bold; color:coral;">Assessment Samples </h2>
											<p style="color:rgb(236, 170, 146); font-weight: bolder;">
												Throughout my professional placements I have demonstrated the teaching of content through a range
												of different assessments, including summative, formative and diagnostic. 
											</p>
										</header>
										
										<p>
											<h3 style="font-weight: bold; color:lightcoral">Diagnostic Assessment</h3>
											A diagnostic assessment is conducted at the start of a lesson to find out what students already 
											know about a topic. 
											<br>
											<br>
											An example from my own lesson: 
											<br>
											At the start of a new term, a year 9 food technology class were starting a new syllabus topic. 
											I got students to use a shared <a href="https://jamboard.google.com/" target="_blank">Jamboard</a>. <!-- makes the word jamboard a clickable link and target blank opens it in a new tab -->
											and tell me what they already knew about the "food for special occassions" topic as well as what they would like to know.
											<br>
											<br>
											
											<a class="image featured"><img src="images/diagnostic.jpg" /></a> <!-- added in the jamboard picture -->
											
											This allowed me as the teacher to know what I needed to focus more time on when preparing lesson content. 
										</p>
										
										<p>
											<h3 style="font-weight: bold; color:lightcoral">Formative Assessment</h3>
											Formative assessment is a process that involves the continuous use of information about students'
											knowledge, understanding and skills to target teaching and address individual students learning needs. 
											Formative assessment provides teachers and students with opportunities for feedback throughout the 
											teaching and learning experience while also providing evidence about progress to inform the next steps 
											in learning. (NESA, n.d)
											<br>
											<br>
											An example from my own lesson: 
											<br>
											I created a compare on contrast, that focused on food cuisines. First students would highlight the example
											then they in a group would write their own and lastly, they would individually write another and submit their 
											response via Google Classroom to get marked.

											href="https://office.com">
											</a> 
											</iframe> <!--  embedding a word document and sizing it. also making sure it opens in a new tab -->
										<br>
										<br>									
											This allowed me to see where they were at with their literacy and allowed their regular teacher to keep track of progress
											based upon other submissions that were of similar style to this one. The teacher could also then further the compare and 
											contrast task if needed or if improvement had been substantial, move on to the next topic.
										</p>

										<p>
											<h3 style="font-weight: bold; color:lightcoral">Summative Assessment</h3>
											A Summative assessment provides evidence of student learning to inform teacher judgements about achievement in relation 
											to the syllabus, and performance standards (NESA, n.d). I can be used to report to teachers, students or parents, the 
											successfulness of learning and application of knowledge. It can also assist teachers in knowing what needs more work.
											<br>
											<br>
											An example from my own lesson: 
											<br>
											At the end of term, students played a specific <a href="https://kahoot.com/" target="_blank">Kahoot</a>  <!-- makes the word jamboard a clickable link and target blank opens it in a new tab -->
											quiz that I made with relevant questions to the syllabus content and outcomes they had been learning about. 
											At the end of the Kahoot, I downloaded the statistics that told me how many questions each student got correct
											as shown below. The statistics go into more detail about which questions students got wrong.
											<br>
											<br>
											
											<a class="image featured"><img src="images/kahoot.jpg" /></a> <!-- added in the jamboard picture -->
											
											This allowed me as the teacher to know what each specific student knew by the end of the term and what i needed to go
											over for the revision lessons set for the exam next term.

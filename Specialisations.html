											<h2 style="color:darkseagreen; font-weight: bold;">Technologies</h2>
											<p style="color:black;">Throughout my degree, I have become competent at teaching multiple teachnology 
												subjects. Each subject and classroom looks a little bit different.
												<br>
												<br>
												With each subject I have linked a picture of a possible project that could be undertaken in the subject.

											<h2 style="color: rgb(229, 157, 94); font-weight: bold;">Food Technology</h2>
											<p> 
												Food Technology equips students with the knowledge and skills to make informed decisions
												regarding food production, preparation, and consumption. The syllabus covers nutrition, 
												food science, food safety, and contemporary food issues, cultivating a deep understanding of 
												the relationship between food, health, and well-being. Students take part in  in both theoretical 
												and practical activities to develop skills related to food and nutrition.
												In stage 6, students build upon knowledge learnt in previous years whilst delving deeper into
												their criticzl thinking and understanding. They undertake less practical lessons though they are used
												to support the theory content.
